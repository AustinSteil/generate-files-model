## üìã Quick Summary

This application uses **localStorage** (browser local storage) to save your form progress locally on your device. All data is **encrypted with your personal passphrase** before being stored using military-grade AES-GCM 256-bit encryption.

**Key Points:**

- ‚úÖ **100% Client-Side**: All encryption happens in your browser
- ‚úÖ **You Control Everything**: You choose when to save, load, or delete
- ‚úÖ **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-GCM 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- ‚úÖ **No Server Storage**: Your data never leaves your device
- ‚úÖ **No Size Limits**: localStorage can handle large, complex forms (5-10 MB typical limit)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Your Responsibility**: If you forget your passphrase, your data is unrecoverable

## üóÑÔ∏è What Is localStorage?

localStorage is a browser feature that allows websites to store data on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone). Unlike cookies:

- **Larger Capacity**: 5-10 MB (vs 4 KB for cookies)
- **Persistent**: Data remains until explicitly deleted
- **Client-Side Only**: Never sent to servers automatically
- **Per-Origin**: Each website has its own isolated storage

In our application, localStorage serves **one primary purpose**: to allow you to safely close your browser without losing your progress on complex forms and data entry.

---

## üéØ How We Use localStorage

**Our localStorage usage is 100% user-controlled and privacy-focused:**

1. **Opt-In Only**: We never store data without your explicit action
2. **Encrypted Always**: All data is encrypted before storage
3. **User-Controlled**: You decide when to save, load, or delete
4. **No Tracking**: We don't track your usage or behavior
5. **No Third-Party Sharing**: Your data stays on your device

### What Gets Stored

When you click "Save Data for Later":

- Form field values (encrypted)
- Job demands table selections (encrypted)
- Work schedule information (encrypted)
- All other form inputs (encrypted)

### What Does NOT Get Stored

- Your passphrase (never stored anywhere)
- Browsing history
- Personal identifiers
- Analytics data

## üîê Security & Encryption

### Encryption Technology

We use **Web Crypto API** with industry-standard encryption:

| Feature | Technology | Details |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Encryption Algorithm** | AES-GCM | 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard |
| **Key Derivation** | PBKDF2 | 100,000 iterations with SHA-256 |
| **Initialization Vector** | Random | 12 bytes, unique per encryption |
| **Salt** | Random | 16 bytes, unique per encryption |
| **Authentication** | GCM Mode | Built-in authentication tag |

### How It Works

1. **You enter a passphrase** (e.g., "MySecretPhrase123")
2. **Key derivation**: Your passphrase is converted to a cryptographic key using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
3. **Random salt & IV**: Unique random values are generated for this encryption
4. **Encryption**: Your form data is encrypted using AES-GCM 256-bit
5. **Storage**: The encrypted data (+ salt + IV) is stored in localStorage
6. **Decryption**: Only someone with your exact passphrase can decrypt the data

### Security Guarantees

‚úÖ **Military-Grade**: AES-256 is approved for TOP SECRET information by the NSA  
‚úÖ **Brute-Force Resistant**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations makes password cracking extremely slow  
‚úÖ **Authenticated**: GCM mode prevents tampering with encrypted data  
‚úÖ **Unique Per Session**: Random salt and IV ensure each encryption is unique

## ‚ö†Ô∏è User Risks & Responsibilities

### What You Need to Know

**This is a convenience feature, not a security vault.** By using this feature, you acknowledge:

#### 1. **Device Security**

- Anyone with access to your device can potentially access your data
- If your device is compromised (malware, keylogger), your data may be at risk
- Physical access to your unlocked device = access to your data

#### 2. **Passphrase Security**

- **If you forget your passphrase, your data is PERMANENTLY LOST**
- There is no "password recovery" or "reset password" option
- We cannot help you recover your data if you forget your passphrase
- Choose a passphrase you will remember

#### 3. **Browser Storage**

- Clearing browser data will delete your saved information
- Uninstalling your browser will delete your saved information
- Browser updates or crashes may corrupt localStorage data

#### 4. **No Backup**

- Data is only stored on this device
- If you lose your device, you lose your data
- We do not have copies of your data

### Legal Disclaimer

**BY USING THIS FEATURE, YOU AGREE THAT:**

- You use this feature at your own risk
- We are not liable for any data loss, theft, or compromise
- You will not hold us responsible for security breaches on your device
- You understand the technical limitations and accept them

## üéõÔ∏è Managing Your Data

### How to Control Your Data

#### **Option 1: Use Our Built-In Controls**

- **Save Data**: Click "Save for Later" button (stores encrypted data in localStorage)
- **Load Data**: Click "Load Saved Data" and enter your passphrase
- **Clear Data**: Click "Clear Saved Data" (removes all stored data)

#### **Option 2: Browser Settings**

You can also manage localStorage through your browser:

**Chrome/Edge:**

1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Local Storage" ‚Üí your site URL
4. Right-click ‚Üí "Clear"

**Firefox:**

1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Storage" tab
3. Click "Local Storage" ‚Üí your site URL
4. Right-click ‚Üí "Delete All"

**Safari:**

1. Preferences ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Manage Website Data
2. Find your site ‚Üí Remove

### Data Expiration

- Saved data is marked to expire after **30 days**
- The application will show you how many days remain
- Expired data is automatically cleared on next visit

## üìä Detailed Storage Information

### Our localStorage Items

| Item Name | Purpose | Encrypted | Size |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------|
| `userFormData` | Your encrypted form data | ‚úÖ Yes | Variable (typically 10-500 KB) |
| `hasStoredData` | Flag indicating data exists | ‚ùå No | ~10 bytes |
| `dataExpiration` | Timestamp for expiration | ‚ùå No | ~20 bytes |

### Third-Party Cookies (QuillJS CDN)

The QuillJS rich text editor library (loaded from CDN) may set analytics cookies:

| Cookie Name | Provider | Purpose | Duration |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|
| `_ga` | Google Analytics | Track QuillJS library usage | ~2 years |
| `_ga_*` | Google Analytics | Enhanced analytics | ~2 years |

**Note**: These cookies track library usage statistics, **NOT your personal form data**. Your encrypted form data is completely separate and inaccessible to these analytics.

## üîÑ Migration from Cookies

**Previous Version**: This application previously used cookies for storage (limited to 4 KB)  
**Current Version**: Now uses localStorage (5-10 MB capacity)

### Automatic Migration

If you have data saved in the old cookie format:

1. The application will automatically detect it
2. When you load your data, it will be migrated to localStorage
3. Old cookies will be automatically cleaned up
4. **Same security**: Encryption method is identical
