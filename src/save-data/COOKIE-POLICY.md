## üç™ What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) to remember information about your visit. They help websites provide a better user experience by remembering your preferences and actions.

**Important Update (October 2025):** This application **no longer uses cookies** for storing your form data. We now use **localStorage** (browser local storage) which provides better capacity and reliability. However, third-party cookies from the QuillJS library CDN are still used for library usage analytics.

---

## üéØ How We Use Cookies

**Our cookie usage is 100% user-controlled and privacy-focused:**

- ‚úÖ **User-Initiated Only**: Our cookies are created ONLY when you explicitly click the "Save for Later" button then enter the encryption phrase.
- ‚úÖ **Client-Side Encryption**: All data is encrypted on your device before being stored
- ‚úÖ **No Server Transmission**: Your data never leaves your device or gets sent to our servers
- ‚úÖ **User-Controlled Access**: Only you have the encryption key (your chosen phrase)
- ‚úÖ **Temporary Storage**: Our cookies automatically expire after 30 days
- ‚ùå **No Tracking**: We do not track your behavior, analytics, or personal information
- ‚ùå **No Marketing**: We do not use cookies for advertising or marketing purposes
- ‚ùå **No Third-Party Sharing**: Your data is never shared with third parties (QuillJS analytics track library usage only, not your data)

### Third-Party CDN Cookies

**Note:** This application loads the QuillJS rich text editor library from a CDN (`cdn.quilljs.com`). The QuillJS CDN sets Google Analytics cookies to track library usage statistics. These cookies:

- Are set by QuillJS/Google Analytics (not by us)
- Track QuillJS library usage across websites (not your personal form data)
- Are used by QuillJS developers to understand library adoption
- Do **NOT** have access to your encrypted form data
- Expire after approximately 2 years
- Are subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [QuillJS's practices](https://quilljs.com/)

These cookies are essential for the basic functionality you've requested:

| **Purpose** | **User Control** | **Can Opt Out?** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Form data preservation | User-initiated only | ‚úÖ Yes - don't use "Save for Later" |

- **Marketing Cookies**: No advertising or personalization
- **Social Media Cookies**: No social media tracking or sharing buttons

## üîç Detailed Cookie Information

### First-Party Cookies (This Website)

**We no longer use first-party cookies for storing form data.** As of October 16, 2025, all form data is stored in **localStorage** instead of cookies.

**Why the change?**

- Cookies have a 4 KB size limit, which was insufficient for complex forms with table data
- localStorage provides 5-10 MB capacity, allowing us to store larger, more complex forms
- Same security: We use the exact same AES-GCM 256-bit encryption

**Legacy cookie cleanup:** If you have old cookie-based data, it will be automatically migrated to localStorage when you load it.

### localStorage Items (Current Storage Method)

| Item Name | Purpose | Encrypted | Size |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------|
| `userFormData` | Your encrypted form data | ‚úÖ Yes (AES-GCM 256-bit) | Variable (10-500 KB typical) |
| `hasStoredData` | Flag indicating data exists | ‚ùå No | ~10 bytes |
| `dataExpiration` | Timestamp for expiration | ‚ùå No | ~20 bytes |

**For full details on localStorage security, see [STORAGE-POLICY.md](./STORAGE-POLICY.md)**

### Third-Party Cookies (QuillJS CDN)

| Cookie Name | Provider | Purpose | Duration | Domain |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| `_ga` | Google Analytics (via QuillJS) | Track QuillJS library usage statistics | ~2 years | `.quilljs.com` |
| `_ga_B37E2WMSPW` | Google Analytics (via QuillJS) | Enhanced analytics for QuillJS usage | ~2 years | `.quilljs.com` |

**Important:** These cookies are set by the QuillJS CDN to track how many websites use their library. They track library usage patterns, **NOT your personal form data or information**. Your encrypted form data is stored in localStorage and is completely inaccessible to these analytics cookies.

### üîê Encryption Details (localStorage)

Our localStorage data uses the same military-grade encryption previously used for cookies:

- **Algorithm**: AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and SHA-256
- **Salt**: Randomly generated 16-byte salt per save operation
- **IV**: Randomly generated 12-byte initialization vector per save operation

**For complete security details, see [STORAGE-POLICY.md](./STORAGE-POLICY.md)**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Encryption

### How Your Data Is Protected

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Your data is encrypted on your device using industry-standard AES-GCM encryption
2. **User-Controlled Keys**: Only you know the encryption phrase - we cannot access your data
3. **No Server Storage**: Encrypted data stays in your browser's localStorage only
4. **Local Storage Only**: Data never leaves your device

### What This Means

- ‚úÖ **Privacy**: Your actual form data is unreadable without your phrase
- ‚úÖ **Control**: You have complete control over your data
- ‚úÖ **Transparency**: All encryption happens in your browser (client-side)
- ‚úÖ **Capacity**: localStorage can handle large, complex forms without size limits

**Our localStorage data** is marked to expire after **30 days** and will be automatically cleared on next visit.

**Third-party QuillJS cookies** expire after approximately **2 years**.

#### **Option 5: Managing Third-Party Analytics Cookies**

QuillJS sets Google Analytics cookies that expire after approximately 2 years. To manage these:

- **Block Third-Party Cookies**: Use browser settings to block third-party cookies
  - Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy and Security ‚Üí Third-party cookies ‚Üí Block third-party cookies
  - Firefox: Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Enhanced Tracking Protection ‚Üí Strict

**Important:** Blocking these analytics cookies will **NOT** affect the rich text editor functionality. The QuillJS library will still work normally; only the usage tracking will be blocked.

### üìÖ Data Expiration Tracking

When you save data, you'll see messages like:
> "Saved data will expire in 30 days"

You can check remaining time by attempting to load your data.
